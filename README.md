Contracts
=========

Two different C# implementations of Code Contracts ala DBC. Example files are provided that show usage.

Basic version uses a single static Contract class.

Advanced version is more granular and uses three different classes - Require (Preconditions), Assume (Invariants), and Verify (Postconditions).

Use either one of them and you will create better software.
